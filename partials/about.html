                The MacGregor Heritage Foundation is a not-for-profit charitable organization dedicated to providing support for children through education and healthcare. At the core of its mission is the principle of empowerment and poverty alleviation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Foundation was established in 2018 by Professor (Dr.) Alexander O. MacGregor, a world-renown pharmaceutical technology expert, educator and successful business entrepreneur. Professor MacGregor's charitable heritage can be traced back to over 150 years of philanthropy started by his grand-father, Chief (Captain) G.B. MacGregor(ca.1863-1965), a World-War I veteran in the late nineteenth century and which continued with his father, Chief Harry Adebisi MacGregor (ca.1934-2011), an investigative journalist and merchant industrialist in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century.
